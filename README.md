###First Steps
* [Register as a Sole Proprietor](https://www.services.gov.on.ca/locations/serviceDetails.do?id=11595&locale=EN): this will only set you back about $60.

* [Register for an HST number](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/gst-tps/rgstrng/menu-eng.html): this is optional! Read the guidelines and decide if this is for you. If you're making more than $30k annually, you'll have to charge HST.
